NSData+SA_NSDataExtensions

Adds utility functions to NSData, that help deal with null termination of C strings.

This category on NSData adds properties that allow you to get the null-terminated or non-null-terminated versions of byte arrays stored as NSData objects, and to easily check whether an NSData's byte array is, or is not, null-terminated (that is, whether its last byte is a null).
